Welcome to ``cryptography``
===========================

``cryptography-pkcs11`` is a backend for the `cryptography`_ Python library.
It provides an interface to use the standard cryptography API with a PKCS#11
device.

**At this time this should be considered experimental software and not ready
for any sort of production use.**

Installation
------------
git clone the `cryptography-pkcs11`_ repository from GitHub, ``cd`` into
the directory, and then run ``python setup.py install``.

Everything Else
---------------
What little documentation there is lives in the README right now.
